<b>Make your own books</b>
Create your book, search for wiki pages, watch images and text flow onto your pages.

<b>Learn with your kids</b>
Interested in biology? Want to build a book for you and your kids to learn more about it? Try creating a new book, add some pages by searching for Organism, Animal, Plant, and then Fungi, then watch your book come to life.

<b>Share your creations</b>
Generate a PDF and email it to a friend, or print it for your own physical book.

<b>Limitations</b>
This is still in the early stages of development. Some things which are on the roadmap:
<ul><li>Proper attribution for Wikipedia sources in resulting PDFs.</li><li>More intuitive swipe controls (e.g. for changing pages when reading, or for re-ordering pages in a book).</li><li>Select your favourite image(s) from a wiki page instead of being forced to use the one the app selected.</li><li>Sharing of books between Android devices to support remixing and improving others books (rather than just PDF export as we have now).</li></ul>
